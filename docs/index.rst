Welcome to |project| documentation!
===================================

``importlib_metadata`` supplies a backport of :mod:`importlib.metadata`,
enabling early access to features of future Python versions and making
functionality available for older Python versions. Users are encouraged to
use the Python standard library where suitable and fall back to
this library for future compatibility. Developers looking for detailed API
descriptions should refer to the standard library documentation.

The documentation here includes a general :ref:`usage <using>` guide.
