v6.1.0
======

* #428: ``packages_distributions`` now honors packages and modules
  with Python modules that not ``.py`` sources (e.g. ``.pyc``,
  ``.so``).

v6.0.1
======

* #434: Expand protocol for ``PackageMetadata.get_all`` to match
  the upstream implementation of ``email.message.Message.get_all``
  in python/typeshed#9620.

v6.0.0
======

* #419: Declared ``Distribution`` as an abstract class, enforcing
  definition of abstract methods in instantiated subclasses. It's no
  longer possible to instantiate a ``Distribution`` or any subclasses
  unless they define the abstract methods.

  Please comment in the issue if this change breaks any projects.
  This change will likely be rolled back if it causes significant
  disruption.

v5.2.0
======

* #371: Deprecated expectation that ``PackageMetadata.__getitem__``
  will return ``None`` for missing keys. In the future, it will raise a
  ``KeyError``.

v5.1.0
======

* #415: Instrument ``SimplePath`` with generic support.

v5.0.0
======

* #97, #284, #300: Removed compatibility shims for deprecated entry
  point interfaces.

v4.13.0
=======

* #396: Added compatibility for ``PathDistributions`` originating
  from Python 3.8 and 3.9.

v4.12.0
=======

* py-93259: Now raise ``ValueError`` when ``None`` or an empty
  string are passed to ``Distribution.from_name`` (and other
  callers).

v4.11.4
=======

* #379: In ``PathDistribution._name_from_stem``, avoid including
  parts of the extension in the result.
* #381: In ``PathDistribution._normalized_name``, ensure names
  loaded from the stem of the filename are also normalized, ensuring
  duplicate entry points by packages varying only by non-normalized
  name are hidden.

v4.11.3
=======

* #372: Removed cast of path items in FastPath, not needed.

v4.11.2
=======

* #369: Fixed bug where ``EntryPoint.extras`` was returning
  match objects and not the extras strings.

v4.11.1
=======

* #367: In ``Distribution.requires`` for egg-info, if ``requires.txt``
  is empty, return an empty list.

v4.11.0
=======

* bpo-46246: Added ``__slots__`` to ``EntryPoints``.

v4.10.2
=======

* #365 and bpo-46546: Avoid leaking ``method_name`` in
  ``DeprecatedList``.

v4.10.1
=======

v2.1.3
=======

* #361: Avoid potential REDoS in ``EntryPoint.pattern``.

v4.10.0
=======

* #354: Removed ``Distribution._local`` factory. This
  functionality was created as a demonstration of the
  possible implementation. Now, the
  `pep517 <https://pypi.org/project/pep517>`_ package
  provides this functionality directly through
  `pep517.meta.load <https://github.com/pypa/pep517/blob/a942316305395f8f757f210e2b16f738af73f8b8/pep517/meta.py#L63-L73>`_.

v4.9.0
======

* Require Python 3.7 or later.

v4.8.3
======

* #357: Fixed requirement generation from egg-info when a
  URL requirement is given.

v4.8.2
======

v2.1.2
======

* #353: Fixed discovery of distributions when path is empty.

v4.8.1
======

* #348: Restored support for ``EntryPoint`` access by item,
  deprecating support in the process. Users are advised
  to use direct member access instead of item-based access::

  - ep[0] -> ep.name
  - ep[1] -> ep.value
  - ep[2] -> ep.group
  - ep[:] -> ep.name, ep.value, ep.group

v4.8.0
======

* #337: Rewrote ``EntryPoint`` as a simple class, still
  immutable and still with the attributes, but without any
  expectation for ``namedtuple`` functionality such as
  ``_asdict``.

v4.7.1
======

* #344: Fixed regression in ``packages_distributions`` when
  neither top-level.txt nor a files manifest is present.

v4.7.0
======

* #330: In ``packages_distributions``, now infer top-level
  names from ``.files()`` when a ``top-level.txt``
  (Setuptools-specific metadata) is not present.

v4.6.4
======

* #334: Correct ``SimplePath`` protocol to match ``pathlib``
  protocol for ``__truediv__``.

v4.6.3
======

* Moved workaround for #327 to ``_compat`` module.

v4.6.2
======

* bpo-44784: Avoid errors in test suite when
  DeprecationWarnings are treated as errors.

v4.6.1
======

* #327: Deprecation warnings now honor call stack variance
  on PyPy.

v4.6.0
======

* #326: Performance tests now rely on
  `pytest-perf <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-perf>`_.
  To disable these tests, which require network access
  and a git checkout, pass ``-p no:perf`` to pytest.

v4.5.0
======

* #319: Remove ``SelectableGroups`` deprecation exception
  for flake8.

v4.4.0
======

* #300: Restore compatibility in the result from
  ``Distribution.entry_points`` (``EntryPoints``) to honor
  expectations in older implementations and issuing
  deprecation warnings for these cases:

  - ``EntryPoints`` objects are once again mutable, allowing
    for ``sort()`` and other list-based mutation operations.
    Avoid deprecation warnings by casting to a
    mutable sequence (e.g.
    ``list(dist.entry_points).sort()``).

  - ``EntryPoints`` results once again allow
    for access by index. To avoid deprecation warnings,
    cast the result to a Sequence first
    (e.g. ``tuple(dist.entry_points)[0]``).

v4.3.1
======

* #320: Fix issue where normalized name for eggs was
  incorrectly solicited, leading to metadata being
  unavailable for eggs.

v4.3.0
======

* #317: De-duplication of distributions no longer requires
  loading the full metadata for ``PathDistribution`` objects,
  entry point loading performance by ~10x.

v4.2.0
======

* Prefer f-strings to ``.format`` calls.

v4.1.0
======

* #312: Add support for metadata 2.2 (``Dynamic`` field).

* #315: Add ``SimplePath`` protocol for interface clarity
  in ``PathDistribution``.

v4.0.1
======

* #306: Clearer guidance about compatibility in readme.

v4.0.0
======

* #304: ``PackageMetadata`` as returned by ``metadata()``
  and ``Distribution.metadata()`` now provides normalized
  metadata honoring PEP 566:

  - If a long description is provided in the payload of the
    RFC 822 value, it can be retrieved as the ``Description``
    field.
  - Any multi-line values in the metadata will be returned as
    such.
  - For any multi-line values, line continuation characters
    are removed. This backward-incompatible change means
    that any projects relying on the RFC 822 line continuation
    characters being present must be tolerant to them having
    been removed.
  - Add a ``json`` property that provides the metadata
    converted to a JSON-compatible form per PEP 566.


v3.10.1
=======

* Minor tweaks from CPython.

v3.10.0
=======

* #295: Internal refactoring to unify section parsing logic.

v3.9.1
======

* #296: Exclude 'prepare' package.
* #297: Fix ValueError when entry points contains comments.

v3.9.0
======

* Use of Mapping (dict) interfaces on ``SelectableGroups``
  is now flagged as deprecated. Instead, users are advised
  to use the select interface for future compatibility.

  Suppress the warning with this filter:
  ``ignore:SelectableGroups dict interface``.

  Or with this invocation in the Python environment:
  ``warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', 'SelectableGroups dict interface')``.

  Preferably, switch to the ``select`` interface introduced
  in 3.7.0. See the
  `entry points documentation <https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#entry-points>`_ and changelog for the 3.6
  release below for more detail.

  For some use-cases, especially those that rely on
  ``importlib.metadata`` in Python 3.8 and 3.9 or
  those relying on older ``importlib_metadata`` (especially
  on Python 3.5 and earlier),
  `backports.entry_points_selectable <https://pypi.org/project/backports.entry_points_selectable>`_
  was created to ease the transition. Please have a look
  at that project if simply relying on importlib_metadata 3.6+
  is not straightforward. Background in #298.

* #283: Entry point parsing no longer relies on ConfigParser
  and instead uses a custom, one-pass parser to load the
  config, resulting in a ~20% performance improvement when
  loading entry points.

v3.8.2
======

* #293: Re-enabled lazy evaluation of path lookup through
  a FreezableDefaultDict.

v3.8.1
======

* #293: Workaround for error in distribution search.

v3.8.0
======

* #290: Add mtime-based caching for ``FastPath`` and its
  lookups, dramatically increasing performance for repeated
  distribution lookups.

v3.7.3
======

* Docs enhancements and cleanup following review in
  `GH-24782 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/24782>`_.

v3.7.2
======

* Cleaned up cruft in entry_points docstring.

v3.7.1
======

* Internal refactoring to facilitate ``entry_points() -> dict``
  deprecation.

v3.7.0
======

* #131: Added ``packages_distributions`` to conveniently
  resolve a top-level package or module to its distribution(s).

v3.6.0
======

* #284: Introduces new ``EntryPoints`` object, a tuple of
  ``EntryPoint`` objects but with convenience properties for
  selecting and inspecting the results:

  - ``.select()`` accepts ``group`` or ``name`` keyword
    parameters and returns a new ``EntryPoints`` tuple
    with only those that match the selection.
  - ``.groups`` property presents all of the group names.
  - ``.names`` property presents the names of the entry points.
  - Item access (e.g. ``eps[name]``) retrieves a single
    entry point by name.

  ``entry_points`` now accepts "selection parameters",
  same as ``EntryPoint.select()``.

  ``entry_points()`` now provides a future-compatible
  ``SelectableGroups`` object that supplies the above interface
  (except item access) but remains a dict for compatibility.

  In the future, ``entry_points()`` will return an
  ``EntryPoints`` object for all entry points.

  If passing selection parameters to ``entry_points``, the
  future behavior is invoked and an ``EntryPoints`` is the
  result.

* #284: Construction of entry points using
  ``dict([EntryPoint, ...])`` is now deprecated and raises
  an appropriate DeprecationWarning and will be removed in
  a future version.

* #300: ``Distribution.entry_points`` now presents as an
  ``EntryPoints`` object and access by index is no longer
  allowed. If access by index is required, cast to a sequence
  first.

v3.5.0
======

* #280: ``entry_points`` now only returns entry points for
  unique distributions (by name).

v3.4.0
======

* #10: Project now declares itself as being typed.
* #272: Additional performance enhancements to distribution
  discovery.
* #111: For PyPA projects, add test ensuring that
  ``MetadataPathFinder._search_paths`` honors the needed
  interface. Method is still private.

v3.3.0
======

* #265: ``EntryPoint`` objects now expose a ``.dist`` object
  referencing the ``Distribution`` when constructed from a
  Distribution.

v3.2.0
======

* The object returned by ``metadata()`` now has a
  formally-defined protocol called ``PackageMetadata``
  with declared support for the ``.get_all()`` method.
  Fixes #126.

v3.1.1
======

v2.1.1
======

* #261: Restored compatibility for package discovery for
  metadata without version in the name and for legacy
  eggs.

v3.1.0
======

* Merge with 2.1.0.

v2.1.0
======

* #253: When querying for package metadata, the lookup
  now honors
  `package normalization rules <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/recording-installed-packages/>`_.

v3.0.0
======

* Require Python 3.6 or later.

v2.0.0
======

* ``importlib_metadata`` no longer presents a
  ``__version__`` attribute. Consumers wishing to
  resolve the version of the package should query it
  directly with
  ``importlib_metadata.version('importlib-metadata')``.
  Closes #71.

v1.7.0
======

* ``PathNotFoundError`` now has a custom ``__str__``
  mentioning "package metadata" being missing to help
  guide users to the cause when the package is installed
  but no metadata is present. Closes #124.

v1.6.1
======

* Added ``Distribution._local()`` as a provisional
  demonstration of how to load metadata for a local
  package. Implicitly requires that
  `pep517 <https://pypi.org/project/pep517>`_ is
  installed. Ref #42.
* Ensure inputs to FastPath are Unicode. Closes #121.
* Tests now rely on ``importlib.resources.files`` (and
  backport) instead of the older ``path`` function.
* Support any iterable from ``find_distributions``.
  Closes #122.

v1.6.0
======

* Added ``module`` and ``attr`` attributes to ``EntryPoint``

v1.5.2
======

* Fix redundant entries from ``FastPath.zip_children``.
  Closes #117.

v1.5.1
======

* Improve reliability and consistency of compatibility
  imports for contextlib and pathlib when running tests.
  Closes #116.

v1.5.0
======

* Additional performance optimizations in FastPath now
  saves an additional 20% on a typical call.
* Correct for issue where PyOxidizer finder has no
  ``__module__`` attribute. Closes #110.

v1.4.0
======

* Through careful optimization, ``distribution()`` is
  3-4x faster. Thanks to Antony Lee for the
  contribution. Closes #95.

* When searching through ``sys.path``, if any error
  occurs attempting to list a path entry, that entry
  is skipped, making the system much more lenient
  to errors. Closes #94.

v1.3.0
======

* Improve custom finders documentation. Closes #105.

v1.2.0
======

* Once again, drop support for Python 3.4. Ref #104.

v1.1.3
======

* Restored support for Python 3.4 due to improper version
  compatibility declarations in the v1.1.0 and v1.1.1
  releases. Closes #104.

v1.1.2
======

* Repaired project metadata to correctly declare the
  ``python_requires`` directive. Closes #103.

v1.1.1
======

* Fixed ``repr(EntryPoint)`` on PyPy 3 also. Closes #102.

v1.1.0
======

* Dropped support for Python 3.4.
* EntryPoints are now pickleable. Closes #96.
* Fixed ``repr(EntryPoint)`` on PyPy 2. Closes #97.

v1.0.0
======

* Project adopts semver for versioning.

* Removed compatibility shim introduced in 0.23.

* For better compatibility with the stdlib implementation and to
  avoid the same distributions being discovered by the stdlib and
  backport implementations, the backport now disables the
  stdlib DistributionFinder during initialization (import time).
  Closes #91 and closes #100.

0.23
====

* Added a compatibility shim to prevent failures on beta releases
  of Python before the signature changed to accept the
  "context" parameter on find_distributions. This workaround
  will have a limited lifespan, not to extend beyond release of
  Python 3.8 final.

0.22
====

* Renamed ``package`` parameter to ``distribution_name``
  as `recommended <https://bugs.python.org/issue34632#msg349423>`_
  in the following functions: ``distribution``, ``metadata``,
  ``version``, ``files``, and ``requires``. This
  backward-incompatible change is expected to have little impact
  as these functions are assumed to be primarily used with
  positional parameters.

0.21
====

* ``importlib.metadata`` now exposes the ``DistributionFinder``
  metaclass and references it in the docs for extending the
  search algorithm.
* Add ``Distribution.at`` for constructing a Distribution object
  from a known metadata directory on the file system. Closes #80.
* Distribution finders now receive a context object that
  supplies ``.path`` and ``.name`` properties. This change
  introduces a fundamental backward incompatibility for
  any projects implementing a ``find_distributions`` method
  on a ``MetaPathFinder``. This new layer of abstraction
  allows this context to be supplied directly or constructed
  on demand and opens the opportunity for a
  ``find_distributions`` method to solicit additional
  context from the caller. Closes #85.

0.20
====

* Clarify in the docs that calls to ``.files`` could return
  ``None`` when the metadata is not present. Closes #69.
* Return all requirements and not just the first for dist-info
  packages. Closes #67.

0.19
====

* Restrain over-eager egg metadata resolution.
* Add support for entry points with colons in the name. Closes #75.

0.18
====

* Parse entry points case sensitively.  Closes #68
* Add a version constraint on the backport configparser package.  Closes #66

0.17
====

* Fix a permission problem in the tests on Windows.

0.16
====

* Don't crash if there exists an EGG-INFO directory on sys.path.

0.15
====

* Fix documentation.

0.14
====

* Removed ``local_distribution`` function from the API.
  **This backward-incompatible change removes this
  behavior summarily**. Projects should remove their
  reliance on this behavior. A replacement behavior is
  under review in the `pep517 project
  <https://github.com/pypa/pep517>`_. Closes #42.

0.13
====

* Update docstrings to match PEP 8. Closes #63.
* Merged modules into one module. Closes #62.

0.12
====

* Add support for eggs.  !65; Closes #19.

0.11
====

* Support generic zip files (not just wheels).  Closes #59
* Support zip files with multiple distributions in them.  Closes #60
* Fully expose the public API in ``importlib_metadata.__all__``.

0.10
====

* The ``Distribution`` ABC is now officially part of the public API.
  Closes #37.
* Fixed support for older single file egg-info formats.  Closes #43.
* Fixed a testing bug when ``$CWD`` has spaces in the path.  Closes #50.
* Add Python 3.8 to the ``tox`` testing matrix.

0.9
===

* Fixed issue where entry points without an attribute would raise an
  Exception.  Closes #40.
* Removed unused ``name`` parameter from ``entry_points()``. Closes #44.
* ``DistributionFinder`` classes must now be instantiated before
  being placed on ``sys.meta_path``.

0.8
===

* This library can now discover/enumerate all installed packages. **This
  backward-incompatible change alters the protocol finders must
  implement to support distribution package discovery.** Closes #24.
* The signature of ``find_distributions()`` on custom installer finders
  should now accept two parameters, ``name`` and ``path`` and
  these parameters must supply defaults.
* The ``entry_points()`` method no longer accepts a package name
  but instead returns all entry points in a dictionary keyed by the
  ``EntryPoint.group``. The ``resolve`` method has been removed. Instead,
  call ``EntryPoint.load()``, which has the same semantics as
  ``pkg_resources`` and ``entrypoints``.  **This is a backward incompatible
  change.**
* Metadata is now always returned as Unicode text regardless of
  Python version. Closes #29.
* This library can now discover metadata for a 'local' package (found
  in the current-working directory). Closes #27.
* Added ``files()`` function for resolving files from a distribution.
* Added a new ``requires()`` function, which returns the requirements
  for a package suitable for parsing by
  ``packaging.requirements.Requirement``. Closes #18.
* The top-level ``read_text()`` function has been removed.  Use
  ``PackagePath.read_text()`` on instances returned by the ``files()``
  function.  **This is a backward incompatible change.**
* Release dates are now automatically injected into the changelog
  based on SCM tags.

0.7
===

* Fixed issue where packages with dashes in their names would
  not be discovered. Closes #21.
* Distribution lookup is now case-insensitive. Closes #20.
* Wheel distributions can no longer be discovered by their module
  name. Like Path distributions, they must be indicated by their
  distribution package name.

0.6
===

* Removed ``importlib_metadata.distribution`` function. Now
  the public interface is primarily the utility functions exposed
  in ``importlib_metadata.__all__``. Closes #14.
* Added two new utility functions ``read_text`` and
  ``metadata``.

0.5
===

* Updated README and removed details about Distribution
  class, now considered private. Closes #15.
* Added test suite support for Python 3.4+.
* Fixed SyntaxErrors on Python 3.4 and 3.5. !12
* Fixed errors on Windows joining Path elements. !15

0.4
===

* Housekeeping.

0.3
===

* Added usage documentation.  Closes #8
* Add support for getting metadata from wheels on ``sys.path``.  Closes #9

0.2
===

* Added ``importlib_metadata.entry_points()``.  Closes #1
* Added ``importlib_metadata.resolve()``.  Closes #12
* Add support for Python 2.7.  Closes #4

0.1
===

* Initial release.
